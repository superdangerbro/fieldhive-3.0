## Latest Session (Property Creation Flow)

### Key Achievements
- Successfully implemented property creation with Mapbox integration
- Added GeoJSON handling for property boundaries
- Integrated PostGIS for spatial data storage
- Created reusable map control hooks

### Technical Insights
1. Component Organization:
   - Breaking down complex map functionality into focused hooks improves maintainability
   - Separating concerns between drawing, events, and data handling makes debugging easier

2. Data Flow:
   - GeoJSON formatting is critical for PostGIS compatibility
   - Need careful handling of coordinate transformations
   - Important to validate spatial data before database operations

3. State Management:
   - Map state needs careful coordination between multiple components
   - Drawing state affects multiple UI elements and behaviors
   - Need to handle async operations (geocoding, saving) gracefully

### Challenges & Solutions
1. Double-click Handling:
   - Mapbox's default double-click zoom interferes with polygon completion
   - Solution: Disable double-click zoom and implement custom handler

2. GeoJSON Formatting:
   - PostGIS requires specific GeoJSON structure
   - Solution: Added utility functions for coordinate formatting

3. Data Synchronization:
   - Need to keep map state in sync with form data
   - Solution: Centralized state management in form hooks

### Next Steps
1. UI/UX Improvements:
   - Add loading states for async operations
   - Improve error messaging
   - Add property boundary editing

2. Data Validation:
   - Add GeoJSON schema validation
   - Validate spatial operations
   - Add error boundaries for map components

3. Testing:
   - Add unit tests for GeoJSON utilities
   - Test PostGIS operations
   - Add integration tests for map interactions
