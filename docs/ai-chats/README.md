# AI Development Logs

This directory contains logs of conversations with Cline AI during the development of FieldHive. These logs serve as documentation for:

1. Design decisions and their rationale
2. Technical solutions to specific challenges
3. Configuration details and setup procedures
4. Architecture evolution and improvements

## Structure

Each log file follows this format:
- `initial-setup.md` - Initial project setup and configuration
- `feature-name.md` - Logs related to specific feature development
- `refactor-name.md` - Logs of major refactoring sessions
- `bugfix-name.md` - Logs of significant bug fixes and their solutions

## Purpose

These logs help:
- Track the evolution of the codebase
- Document complex decisions
- Provide context for future development
- Share knowledge about the system's architecture
- Maintain a history of AI-assisted development

## Guidelines for New Logs

When adding new AI chat logs:

1. Create a new markdown file with a descriptive name
2. Include the date of the conversation
3. Structure the content with clear headings
4. Document key decisions and their rationale
5. Include relevant code snippets or configurations
6. Remove any sensitive information
7. Add a brief summary at the top

## Using These Logs

- Reference these logs when working on related features
- Use them to understand the context of specific implementations
- Consult them when making architectural decisions
- Share them with new team members for onboarding

## Note on Sensitive Information

- Never commit sensitive credentials or tokens
- Remove or redact any private information
- Use placeholder values for sensitive data
- Document the existence and purpose of redacted information
