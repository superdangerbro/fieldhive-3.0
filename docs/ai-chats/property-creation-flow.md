# Property Creation Flow Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented the property creation flow with Mapbox integration for drawing property boundaries. The flow includes:
- Address geocoding
- Interactive map with drawing tools
- GeoJSON data handling
- PostgreSQL PostGIS integration

## Key Insights
1. GeoJSON formatting is critical:
   - Need proper coordinate formatting before sending to PostGIS
   - Must handle both Point (location) and Polygon (boundary) types correctly
   - Important to validate GeoJSON structure before database operations

2. Component Architecture:
   - Separated map controls into reusable hooks
   - Split complex functionality into smaller, focused hooks:
     - useDrawControl: Manages Mapbox GL Draw control
     - useDrawHandler: Handles drawing events
     - useMapEvents: Manages map event listeners
     - usePropertyGeocoding: Handles address geocoding
     - usePropertySubmit: Manages form submission

3. Database Considerations:
   - PostGIS functions require specific GeoJSON format
   - SRID 4326 is required for geographic coordinates
   - Need proper error handling for spatial operations

## Next Steps
1. Fix PropertiesTable address display:
   - Currently trying to access serviceAddress.address1 but API returns flat address string
   - Need to update column definition to match API response

2. Improve error handling:
   - Add better validation for GeoJSON data
   - Implement proper error messages for spatial operations
   - Handle edge cases in drawing interactions

3. Enhance UX:
   - Add loading states during geocoding
   - Improve feedback during drawing operations
   - Add property boundary editing capabilities

4. Testing:
   - Add tests for GeoJSON transformations
   - Test PostGIS operations
   - Validate drawing tool interactions
